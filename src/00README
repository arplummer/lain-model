The Lain model of vowel normalization acquisition


Description
-----------

The Lain model is a computational modeling framework that implements a
theory of the acquisition of vowel normalization during infancy.  This
distribution of the Lain model is composed of a "base model" and
supplemental "modules."  The base model implements the core of the
Lain model, including manifold formation, manifold alignment, and
response field generation.  Each module consists of implementations
targeted at demonstrating or modeling specific aspects of speech
perception and production as they pertain to the acquisition of vowel
normalization.
