# lain-model

The Lain model implements a theoretical model that couches the acquisition of vowel normalization in terms of an infant's generation and alignment of cognitive models of the self and others.  The theoretical model is situated
within a fuller conceptual framework sketched in <a href="http://learningtotalk.org/sites/learningtotalk.org/files/publications/PlummerBeckman2015acceptedJPhon.pdf"
title="Socio-indexical Basis">Plummer and Beckman (2015)</a> and elaborated in a series of forthcoming papers.

Right now, the <code>src</code> directory contains a <code>base-model</code> and a <code>demos-module</code> that are the core of the <code>lain-model</code> and illustrate its fundamental computations.  More modules will be released in the coming weeks.   

<b>On the name:</b> I was told that I needed to give the model a name, so I chose an homage to the main character in the late 90's anime <em>Serial Experiments Lain</em>, which was about identity and computation, but a sciencey retcon might be something like <b>La</b>placian <b>in</b>fant Model, OWHY.
